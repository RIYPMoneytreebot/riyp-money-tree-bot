All core functions covered by automated tests
Milestone 2 — Lending Automation Integration (Aave)
Duration: Weeks 4–6
Status: Planned
Objectives
Enable automated lending and borrowing workflows
Integrate with a production-grade DeFi lending protocol
Enforce collateral and risk constraints
Deliverables
Aave protocol adapter contracts
Automated supply, borrow, repay, and rebalance functions
Chainlink oracle integration for risk monitoring
Testnet deployment and integration tests
Success Criteria
Automated lending strategies execute correctly on testnet
Risk parameters prevent unsafe execution
Oracle data successfully informs strategy decisions
Milestone 3 — Yield Execution Module (Uniswap)
Duration: Weeks 7–8
Status: Planned
Objectives
Enable on-chain yield execution via DEX interactions
Support composable strategy building
Maintain transparency and auditability
Deliverables
Uniswap interaction module
Yield routing and rebalancing logic
Slippage and execution safeguards
Unit and integration tests
Success Criteria
